# THU-DSA-PAs-LABs-Answer

This repo includes all answer to the PAs and LABs of Year 2021 DSA course of Tsinghua University. All zipfiles' unzip keys are in the format of  **Problem's Name + \_TAsAreSonOfBitch!**. For example, the unzip key of LAB1 Zuma is "Zuma_TAsAreSonOfBitch!" 

You need to modify these code before submit them in order not to be bited by the evil TAs especially ÁΩóÂ¥öÈ™Åüßü. There are some tricks to lower the similarity between codes including:
+ Change variables' name
+ Create more class and struct
+ Split and merge functions
+ Define some global variables to replace local variables in main funtion
+ Download the check.zip and run the exe file in the dir. Compare the similarity between your code and original code and ensure it is lower than 60%, which is the warning line of Èõ∑Âêå set by the stupid TAs.üí© By the way, the unzip key of check.zip is "check_TAsAreSonOfBitch!"

To be honest, it's really shitty, stupid and most of all **useless** to spend over two or three days on PAs and LABs to handle exceptions beyond algorithms. Just try to understand the logic, data structure and algorithms in these code which are the **only useful part** of PAs and LABs. Then try to lower the similarity. Ideally, you can save almost 70% time to complete PAs and LABs (get all the black scores) without being warned if you follow above steps.
